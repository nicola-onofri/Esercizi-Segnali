This repository is intended to be a shortcut to access to all lectures and solutions of the exercises given in class.

In every folder you'll find my m-files, written in [Octave]( https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), a scientific programming language, largely compatible with Matlab (you can import all my solutions in your MATLAB environment with no effort).

I take __no responsibility__  for the proposed solutions. Feel free to contact me for any issue or any suggestion that can make my code more efficient and performant.

Click [here](http://elearning.unibs.it/mod/folder/view.php?id=47688) for the complete list of exercises and lectures.
